# Information Retrieval and Text Mining course (DAT640), University of Stavanger

This repository contains course material (lectures, labs, and assignments) for the 2021 fall edition of the course (previous editions: [2020](https://github.com/kbalog/uis-dat640-fall2020) and [2019](https://github.com/kbalog/uis-dat640-fall2019)).

Announcements and assignment deliveries are on Canvas.

## Course format

The course follows a **flipped classroom** format, where students learn the course material independently and asynchronously prior the in-class sessions (watching pre-recorded lecture videos and reading the textbook/notes/articles).  Classroom time is devoted to active learning, including discussions and answering questions, laboratory exercises, and assignments.

The semester is divided into two periods, with lectures and indiviual assignments during the first ten weeks (weeks 34-43), and group project work during the last three weeks (weeks 44-46).
